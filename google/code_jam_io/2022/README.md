# README

I participated in Google Codejam to I/O Women, having been my first individual competition. (I've participated previously with my team in Google Hashcode).

However, I unfortunately wasn't able to score any points, having only been able to pass the sample inputs in problem A.

Despite this, I found it a learning experience. Here are some of my main takeaways from having participated in my first individual coding competition:
- I need to test my code thoroughly before submitting: the sample inputs are not enough. I need to think about all the possible edge cases, and try to see if my code can handle them.
- I need to be quicker at parsing input: perhaps due to not being yet completely familiarized with C++ (at time of writing), I struggled a lot with parsing the input, having spent almost half an hour trying to make the parsing work.
- I need to think through my answers: when my submission failed for the first time, I assumed it was a problem parsing input, and not my actual solution that was failing. The second time I submitted, I still assumed my solution was mostly right, and didn't bother to test it any further, or to think further about how to design my solution. Only on the third try did I really sit down with a pen and paper to think through what I was doing and write down some new test cases to understand where it was failing. 
- I need to move on if one problem isn't working: I spent the whole two and a half hours trying to solve one problem. I might have been more successful if I had actually moved on to another problem.

My attempts can be seen in the codejam leaderboard, my user is @catarinacarreiro. I don't think they're interesting enough to share, considering they're incorrect. Instead, I'll share my solutions in this repo as I work through the problems in my own time. 

See you in the next competition!
